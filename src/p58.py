        Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a 
        square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

        It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom 
        right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 
        numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 
        8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

        If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
        spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
        what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of 
        primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
